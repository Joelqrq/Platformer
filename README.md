# Skyland Dash
This game project was developed to participate in [Weekly Game Jam - Week 130](https://joelquey.itch.io/skyland-dash).

# Description
There’s a scrapyard up in the clouds, held there by huge, stone wheels made of magic. Sometimes all the thrash lines up perfectly, forming pathways. Luckily, your favorite pastime happens to be racing these dangerous routes by foot.

Run, jump, double jump and dash while trying to reach the finish line as fast as possible to get the best time. Levels are made of floating objects and islands up in the sky. Fall off and it’s over, but you can instantly try again.

Every time you fail, you get to respawn and choose a new power-up to help you with the level.

# Goal
Run, jump, double jump and dash through the levels.
Try to reach the goal without falling down.
Getting a super fast time guarantees you’re a cool person and will achieve success in life.
